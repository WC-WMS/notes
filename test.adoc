:keywords: Asciidoctor, header, footer, docinfo
 
Using the `docinfo` attributes we can include custom content
in the header and footer. Contents of the files
named `docinfo.html` and `docinfo-footer.html` are included.
 
We can choose between general or document specific custom
header and footer content.

You can use it inline as well, for example:

[source,asciidoc]
....
Water (stem:[H_2O]) is a critical component.
....

Which renders like this: Water (stem:[H_2O]) is a critical component.

[TIP]
There's no need for special delimiters around the expression as the MathJax documentation suggests.
This is handled automatically by Asciidoctor!

The default notation is AsciiMath, but LaTeX can be used like this:

[source,asciidoc]
....
latexmath:[C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon]
....

latexmath:[C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon]

[[ui-macros]]
=== icon:keyboard-o[] Keyboard shortcuts and more

:url-ui-macros: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#user-interface-macros

This is a common shortcut on Windows systems: kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Delete].

Here's the source:
....
btn:[Save]
....

[NOTE]
Here on DocGist we use actual (extra small) buttons from Bootstrap.
In normal Asciidoctor it would have looked more along the lines of *[ Save ]*.

Yet another nifty feature, representing a menu item:

menu:File[New...]

Source:

[source,asciidoc]
....
menu:File[New...]
....

[IMPORTANT]
Representing keyboard shortcuts, buttons, and menu items are experimental features in Aciidoctor.
DocGist has the `experimental` flag set by default for your convenience!

For the reference documentation, see {url-ui-macros}[User Interface Macros].

[[tips]]
=== icon:exclamation-circle[] Tips and tricks

Links to other DocGists can use this syntax: `+link:./?5897167[DocGist intro]+` which renders as link:./?
5897167[DocGist intro].
This makes things easier in case you run DocGist locally to fiddle with the "`backend`" (it's a frontend 
really).

You can view the source Gist of this page by clicking on the green button in the navbar.

How about some UML?
The following image is included using the syntax [src-asciidoc]`image::http://yuml.me/c9ce39b0.png[]`.

image::http://yuml.me/c9ce39b0.png[]

The URL is a reference to a yUML image.
yUML is tool for creating UML diagrams online.

[[source-documents]]
=== icon:file-text-o[] Source documents

DocGist can view documents fetched from a number of different sources.
It parses the URL to find out how to use it, and tries to be a bit smart to keep DocGist URLs short.

[horizontal]
GitHub Gist::
A public or private GitHub Gist can be used.
Example URL: https://gist.github.com/nawroth/5897167

Dropbox Public folder::
Put a file in the _Public_ folder of your Dropbox, grab the URL to it.
Example URL: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10666617/AsciiDoc/example.adoc

Dropbox shared private file::
Use the share-link of a private file in Dropbox.
Example URL: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttib5v9pfs23p9z/example.adoc

Copy.com::
Use the public link to the document.
Example URL: https://copy.com/LdKsHnQbEZsl29BW

Etherpad::
http://etherpad.org/[Etherpad] is an online editor providing collaborative editing in real-time.
There are different Etherpad hosts, these are ones that worked well when we tried them:
https://beta.etherpad.org/, https://piratepad.ca/, https://factor.cc/pad/, https://pad.systemli.org/, htt
ps://pad.fnordig.de/, https://notes.typo3.org/, https://pad.lqdn.fr/, https://pad.okfn.org/, https://beta
.publishwith.me/, https://etherpad.tihlde.org/, https://pad.tihlde.org/, https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/,
 https://etherpad.fr/, https://piratenpad.de/, https://bitpad.co.nz/, http://notas.dados.gov.br/, http://
free.primarypad.com/, http://board.net/, https://pad.odoo.com/, http://pad.planka.nu/, http://qikpad.co.u
k/, http://pad.tn/, http://lite4.framapad.org/, http://pad.hdc.pw/
Note that the content might get removed from the host after some time.
Example URL: https://beta.etherpad.org/p/docgist

Google Docs Documents::
Write normal AsciiDoc in the document.
Then use the _share_ link, set so that anyone with the link can view (at least) the document.
Example URL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lEQTEAQRVxTtDfQ1N9HJ6azeOLYCKlGG17NOs72NWsU/edit

Any URL::
DocGist accepts documents from any host which allows for cross-domain requests.
This is the kind of error you'll see in the console when a host doesn't support it:
+
....
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
Origin 'http://gist.asciidoctor.org' is therefore not allowed access.
....
+
To make it work, the server should respond with one of the following headers:
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin:http://gist.asciidoctor.org` or
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*`.

[TIP]
.Additional services that should get added?
====
Please tell us if there's some additional service you'd like to see support for.
There's two different ways a host can be integrated:

Direct file access::
Dropbox and Google Docs are examples of this.
We only calculate the URL of the file, and request it.
The server must respond with the correct headers as outlined above.


Through a public API::
This is what we use for GitHub.
Note that we can only use an API as long as authorization isn't required.

//
To suggest an addition, file an https://github.com/asciidoctor/docgist/issues/[issue]!
